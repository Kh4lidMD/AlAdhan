Installation
============

You can install the latest version of the package from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install aladhan-api

Or if you have an older version of the package installed, you can upgrade it using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install aladhan-api --upgrade

.. Note:: The current pip domain ``aladhan-api`` will be changed in the first stable release to ``al-adhan`` *which is already taken*.
