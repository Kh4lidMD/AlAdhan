Welcome to Al Adhan Python API's documentation!
===============================================

This is a Python module that allows users to easily calculate accurate prayer times for any location at any date and time. Utilizing the aladhan.com prayer times API, this module converts API responses into Python objects for easy integration into Python. No API keys, authentication, or registration is required, thanks to the generosity of aladhan.com in providing this API. This module is a convenient wrapper for accessing the aladhan.com prayer times API and simplifies the process of using this data in Python projects.

.. Note:: This module is still in development and under alpha version, so it may have some bugs, and the API may have major changes in the future.
