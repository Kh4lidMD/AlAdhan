Welcome to Al Adhan Python API's documentation!
===============================================

This Python module calculates accurate Islamic prayer times for any location. It uses the aladhan.com prayer times API and converts the API responses into Python objects. No API key or registration is required. This module simplifies the process of using the aladhan.com prayer times API in Python projects.

.. Note:: This module is still in development and under alpha version, so it may have some bugs, and the API may have major changes in the future.
