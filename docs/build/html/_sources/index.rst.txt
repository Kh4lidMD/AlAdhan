Welcome to Al Adha Python API's documentation!
==============================================

This is a Python module (or package) that calculate the Islamic prayer times for any location in the world at any time and date, it works depending on the `aladhan.com prayer times API <https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api>`_, and it's a wrapper for it. What this module does is converting the JSON API responses to Python objects, so you can use them in your Python projects very easily. And all of this without API keys, authentication, or registration. Thanks to aladhan.com for providing this API.

.. Note:: This module is still in developmen and under alpha version, so it may have some bugs, and the API may have major changes in the future.
